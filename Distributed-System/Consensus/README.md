FLP不可能定理(由)：No completely asynchronous consensus protocol can tolerate even a single unannounced process death  
但是**科学告诉你，什么是不可能的；工程则告诉你，付出一些代价，可以把它变成可行。**

>Science tells you what is possible; engineering tells you what is practical. Science has given us powerful new tools for understanding the limitations of the natural world, but science alone does not tell us what we can or should do with that knowledge. Science tells us that the universe is expanding at an increasing rate; engineering tells us how to build a telescope that can see billions of years into the past. Science tells us that matter can be converted into energy; engineering tells us how to build a nuclear reactor. Science tells us how nature works; engineering tells us how to make it work for us. Science tells you what is impossible; engineering tells you what is impossibly expensive. Science tells you what is possible; engineering tells you what is profitable.
